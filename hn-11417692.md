Title: 	Ask HN: Do you feel like you're paying too much taxes?

Politically I vote Democratic at the Federal level and a mix between Democrats and Republicans at State/local level. That's shifted in recent years as the GOP has purged moderates out of the NY State party.

I think we should either pay enough taxes to cover our routine government expenses, or cut the expenses to meet the revenues from taxes.

Generally the GOP talks about cutting taxes and spending, but shifts the burden to debt and various user fees. Democrats get blamed for raising taxes, but generally raise taxes to meet existing obligations (as well as use taxes as punitive means to change social or business policy).

For 2014 my household had an AGI of approximately $900k, of which we paid around $250k in US Federal taxes, roughly $70k in NY State taxes, and another $32k in NYC taxes. So, roughly 42% tax rate when you combine all three (I'm ignoring sales taxes).

I don't think I pay too much in tax.

Would I like it to be less? Sure. But I like having roads that are paved, bridges that don't fall down, police and firemen who are paid a decent wage. None of these services are free. Many of these services (at least in NYC) started out as commercial services in the 1800s and shifted to being government produced and funded.

You know why? Because humans suck at forecasting their own needs. I don't have kids, but I pay for schools in my taxes. I don't plan to have a fire, or be the victim of a crime, yet I continue to subsidize the people who are victims of crimes, even (indirectly) the people who commit those crimes.

Americans seem to be uniquely blind to the benefits of the social system weâ€™ve created over the past 230+ years. All we see are the system, its bugs and inefficiencies, the corruption, the costs. We fail to recognize the benefits.

The US economy is an *extremely imperfect* capitalist system, but until someone explains to me clearly, without waving hands, or relying on the Laffer curve, how to fund socially shared obligations without paying taxes, then I'll pay them and use other forms of influence to try to change how my taxes are used.

Because the alternative is to resort to building a castle and a moat, and hiring a bunch of flunkies to guard me and my moat and my money, and effectively create my own little government.
