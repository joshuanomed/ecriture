I think you need better tax advice.

An LLC only pays taxes if it has elected to be treated as a C corp by the IRS, otherwise income & losses pass through to the members.

An C or S corp only makes sense as a sole-proprietor if you have substantial other assets to protect, or expect to accept investments from non–individuals.

You need far better tax advice than you're getting, wherever you're getting it from.

If your goal is to pay absolutely no taxes, then that's not going to happen if you want to rely on the systems those taxes pay for in the US.

If your goal is to legitimately reduce taxes and spread income over multiple years, there's legal ways to do so which a proper tax advisor can guide you through.
